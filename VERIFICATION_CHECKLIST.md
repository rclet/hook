### Code Review Checklist

#### Auth Models
- [ ] AuthUser has `role` field (optional String)
- [ ] AuthUser has `isAdmin` getter
- [ ] isAdmin checks `role?.toLowerCase() == 'admin'`
- [ ] Generated code includes role serialization

#### Auth Service
- [ ] `isAdmin()` method checks current user's role
- [ ] `verifyAuth()` method calls `GET /api/auth/me`
- [ ] verifyAuth updates stored user data
- [ ] Methods handle errors gracefully

#### Router Service
- [ ] Login route exists: `/login`
- [ ] Register route exists: `/register`
- [ ] Admin route exists: `/admin`
- [ ] Admin sub-routes exist: `/admin/users`, etc.
- [ ] Redirect guard checks authentication
- [ ] Guard calls `verifyAuth()` for admin routes
- [ ] Guard redirects unauthorized users properly
- [ ] Deep linking still works

#### Home Screen
- [ ] Imports `AuthService`
- [ ] Checks `isAdmin` on screen load
- [ ] Shows admin button only if `isAdmin == true`
- [ ] Admin button has distinct styling (amber background)
- [ ] Admin button navigates to `/admin`

#### Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Has welcome card
- [ ] Shows stat cards (users, gigs, orders, revenue)
- [ ] Has action cards for navigation
- [ ] Logout button works
- [ ] Navigation to sub-screens works

#### Tests
- [ ] Tests for role field parsing
- [ ] Tests for isAdmin getter
- [ ] Tests for case-insensitive role check
- [ ] Tests for null role handling
- [ ] Tests for JSON serialization with role

## üß™ Manual Testing

#### 7. Token Expiry
- [ ] Login as admin
- [ ] Wait for token to expire or manually clear token
- [ ] Try to access admin panel
