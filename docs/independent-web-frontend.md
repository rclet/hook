# Independent Web Frontend Option

You can build a fully independent web frontend using any modern web technology (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, Angular, etc.) and connect it to your backend (PHP, Node.js, etc.) via APIs. This approach is not limited by Flutter or Firebase.

## How to Connect to Backend
- Use HTTP requests (AJAX, fetch, axios, etc.) to communicate with your backend API (e.g., PHP running on XAMPP).
- You can use Composer for PHP dependency management on the backend, but it is not required for the frontend.
- Host your frontend and backend separately or together, depending on your deployment needs.

## Benefits
- Full control over frontend design and technology.
- No dependency on Flutter or Firebase unless you choose to use them.
- Easily integrate with any backend technology.

For your current project, you can continue with Flutter Web or create a separate web frontend as needed.
